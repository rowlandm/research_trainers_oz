Public place for discussing training around research in Australia

This is a starting place to discuss training. Initially started with the DEVL/RDC projects, we are hoping it will be of use to the general training community. We want the community to take ownership of this, so please provide feedback on anything and everything.

We will be start by putting information/comments/ideas in the issues part of this github. Please add your ideas of what you want to discuss or learn about as an issue. Hopefully that issue is a hot topic and you will get links to materials, ideas and practical feedback based on experience. Also you can see if there are other people who would like to ask more questions and then you could help to organise a video conference call.

It might be that we have a meeting every month where the feedback in the issues is used to decide what the topic will be for that month. This can all be discussed in the issues.

There is a chatroom on gitter that you are welcome to use:
https://gitter.im/research_trainers_oz/Lobby

We may turn on the Wiki later on.

We won't need to add anything on this github, we are only using the issues now. If you want an introduction tutorial, please see this link: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
