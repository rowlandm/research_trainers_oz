# research_trainers_oz
Public place for discussing training around research in Australia

This is a starting place to discuss training. Initially started with the DEVL/RDC projects, we are hoping it will be of use to the general training community. We want the community to take ownership of this, so please provide feedback on anything and everything.

We will be start by putting information/comments/ideas in the issues part of this github. We may turn on the Wiki later on.

For trainers new to github, here is an explanation of how you can contribute:
