Public place for trainers working around research in the digital/data space in Australia. Think of this as a placeholder for seeing if there is an appetite for having a central research focused training community space.

This is a starting place to:
- meet up with like minded trainers working predominantly with researchers and postgrad students in the digital/data space
- share knowledge with other trainers that may be in different domains
- share stories and experience in the training community
- ask questions to other trainers 
- highlighting upcoming events to the trainer community

If you want to comment, ask a question or share training materials, you can sign up to github (takes 4 minutes). It's the equivalent of creating a comment in a google document or adding a comment to a blogpost.

You can see the current discussion with the link below, or via the Issues tab. You can also create your own issue if you want.

We will be start by putting information/comments/ideas in the issues part of this github. Please add your ideas of what you want to discuss or learn about as an issue. Hopefully that issue is a hot topic and you will get links to materials, ideas and practical feedback based on experience. Also you can see if there are other people who would like to ask more questions and then you could help to organise a video conference call.

It might be that we have a meeting every month where the feedback in the issues is used to decide what the topic will be for that month. This can all be discussed in the issues.

There is a chatroom on gitter that you are welcome to use:

We may turn on the Wiki later on.

We won't need to add anything on this github, we are only using the issues now. If you want an introduction tutorial, please see this link: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
